# Gmail Agent Registration System - Core Requirements

## Project Goal
Create a complete Gmail agent registration system that allows clients to authorize Gmail access through a web interface, securely manages their credentials, integrates with external automation systems via webhooks, and automatically maintains Gmail watch subscriptions for real-time email monitoring.

## Business Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Client Registration Portal**
   - Public-facing web interface for new client onboarding
   - Secure OAuth 2.0 flow for Gmail authorization
   - Collection of client metadata (name, company, contact info)
   - Clear consent and permission explanations

2. **Credential Management**
   - Secure storage of OAuth tokens (access & refresh)
   - Automatic token refresh before expiration
   - Encryption of sensitive data at rest
   - Client credential lifecycle management

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Webhook-based notification system for new registrations
   - Standardized data format for external system consumption
   - Retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
   - Real-time or batch processing options

4. **Gmail Monitoring**
   - Establish Gmail watch subscriptions for each client
   - Monitor specified labels/folders (typically INBOX)
   - Auto-renewal of watch subscriptions before expiration
   - Push notification system for email events

## Functional Requirements

### User Journey
1. Client visits registration page
2. Fills out basic information form
3. Initiates Gmail authorization flow
4. Reviews and approves requested permissions
5. System captures and stores credentials
6. Sends registration data to automation platform
7. Sets up Gmail monitoring for the client
8. Displays success confirmation

### System Capabilities

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Gmail API access with appropriate scopes (read, send, compose, modify)
- Secure OAuth 2.0 implementation
- Session management for registration flow

#### Data Management
- Persistent storage for client records
- Token storage with encryption
- Watch subscription metadata
- Audit trail of registrations and renewals

#### Integration Points
- Webhook endpoints for registration events
- Webhook endpoints for watch renewal status
- API for querying registered clients
- Status checking capabilities

#### Automation Requirements
- Daily/periodic check for expiring watch subscriptions
- Automatic renewal process (watches expire after ~7 days)
- Notification system for renewal failures
- Token refresh automation

## Technical Considerations

### Security Requirements
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Token encryption at rest
- Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded secrets)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- CSRF protection for web forms
- Secure session handling

### Scalability Needs
- Handle multiple concurrent registrations
- Efficient database queries for renewal checks
- Asynchronous webhook processing
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities

### Data Schema Requirements

#### Client Record Structure
```
Client:
  - Unique identifier
  - Personal/company information
  - Gmail address
  - OAuth tokens (encrypted)
  - Token expiration timestamps
  - Watch subscription details
  - Registration timestamp
  - Last renewal timestamp
  - Webhook delivery status
```

### Integration Data Format

#### Registration Webhook Payload
```json
{
  "clientId": "unique_identifier",
  "registrationData": {
    "name": "client_name",
    "email": "contact_email",
    "company": "company_name",
    "gmailAddress": "gmail_address"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "accessToken": "encrypted_access_token",
    "refreshToken": "encrypted_refresh_token",
    "expiryDate": "token_expiry_timestamp"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "registeredAt": "registration_timestamp",
    "watchExpiration": "watch_expiry_timestamp"
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria
